Eventually, we must find a way to create/read/update/delete (CRUD) recipe/repices.  We started a page for reading one recipe. We can try to create in the database a table to store recipes and insert the data for our one recipe.

Create database.rb.  Add 'sqlite3' to Gemfile.  bundle install.  rbenv rehash

Try to create a recipe table in database.rb.

Each row is a recipe.

7 columns: name, yield (servings), time prepare, time cook, ingredients, directions, special notes (optional).

A column can only hold one piece of info.  1 column cannot hold all ingredients, must create another table for ingredients as well as directions.

Created a table that has 4 columns:  name, servings, preparation_minutes, cook_minutes.

Created 'zuppa tuscana' recipe.

*Once a table is created, re-running with additional info will cause error.  Must remove thienscorner.db before re-running database.rb.

Next step: Using Angular.JS and Sinatra and Sequel to read 'zuppa tuscana' recipe from the database and display as html file.
